To do this we will first rotate about N1 90 degrees to get N2 to align to R3. The we will rotate 180 degrees about the new N2 (aka R3) vector to get -N1 to align with R1 since N1 is still in place but we want it to be -180 out of alignment. I will use my euler angle functions to get this matrix.\n",
